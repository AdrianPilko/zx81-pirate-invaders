# ZX81 Pirate Invaders
A zx81 game which brings a maritime angle to an old classic


pivaders.asm is the main file.

I'm in the process of moving from tasm to pasmo as the assembler of choice.

There are two options for building, although the second one isn't constantly updated.

either (on MS Windows) install tasm assembler and use build.bat to assemble
OR
on (on Linux) install pasmo and run build_using_pasmo.sh 

these however two currently build different .asm files and going forward this isn't sustainable as manually have to update one or the other since the assemblers have slightly different syntax.
